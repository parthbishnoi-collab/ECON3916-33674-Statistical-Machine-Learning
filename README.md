# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository serves as my digital portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**, where I explore how modern data science tools can be used to deepen and extend traditional economic analysis.

## 👋 About Me

I am an undergraduate **Economics student** actively preparing for roles in **Data Analysis, Economic Consulting, and Finance**.  
My academic and professional interests lie in bridging the gap between **economic theory, causal reasoning, and modern machine learning techniques** to generate insights that are both statistically rigorous and practically relevant.

This portfolio reflects my growth as an economist who can think critically about data, models, and real-world decision-making.

## 📂 About This Portfolio

This repository contains my **coursework, labs, and applied exercises** from ECON 3916.

The course follows a **Concept Extension** philosophy:  
we begin with foundational statistical tools such as **linear regression and hypothesis testing**, and progressively extend them using **machine learning algorithms** like **Lasso and other regularized models**.

Throughout this work, I focus on:
- Combining **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**
- Understanding trade-offs between **interpretability and performance**
- Applying models thoughtfully in an economic context rather than as black boxes

Each notebook emphasizes both **theory and implementation**, reflecting how these tools are used in real analytical and policy environments.

## 🚀 Goals

By the end of this course, my goal is to demonstrate the ability to:
- Translate economic questions into data-driven frameworks  
- Build, evaluate, and interpret statistical and machine learning models  
- Communicate insights clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences  

Thank you for visiting — I’m excited to keep learning and building.
