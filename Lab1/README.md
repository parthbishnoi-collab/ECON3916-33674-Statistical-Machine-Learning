## Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis via the Big Mac Index

### Objective  
This project applies the Big Mac Index as an informal test of the **Law of One Price**, evaluating whether exchange rates correctly reflect relative price levels across countries under purchasing power parity (PPP).

### Methodology  
- Constructed a country-level dataset using **The Economist’s 2015 Big Mac Index**, manually ingesting local Big Mac prices and prevailing market exchange rates.  
- Calculated **implied PPP exchange rates** by comparing local Big Mac prices to the U.S. benchmark price.  
- Measured **currency misalignment** by computing the percentage overvaluation or undervaluation of each currency relative to the U.S. dollar.  
- Analyzed deviations from PPP to assess the presence of price distortions, market frictions, and limits to arbitrage.

### Key Findings  
The analysis reveals meaningful deviations from purchasing power parity across countries, indicating that exchange rates do not fully equalize prices in the short run. For example, the **Norwegian Krone** appears **overvalued by X%** relative to the U.S. dollar, suggesting higher domestic price levels than implied by PPP. Conversely, several emerging market currencies exhibit **undervaluation**, consistent with lower non-tradable costs and structural market differences. These results highlight the role of transportation costs, taxes, wage differentials, and imperfect arbitrage in explaining persistent departures from the Law of One Price.
